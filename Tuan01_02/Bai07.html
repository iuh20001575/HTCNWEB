            A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles
        at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles
        to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the 
        corner of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles 
        performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
